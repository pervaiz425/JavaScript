<!-- When the page loaded, JavaScript loaded the paragraph the way I wrote it, 
    and then what the scripted is it went in and found that element with the ID 
    of one, and it added the style attribute here and set its color property to red. 
    JavaScript is doing that on the fly after the page has been retrieved. Right now 
    we're just loading it from our desktop. But you could be getting it off of the 
    webserver, you'd be getting it from anywhere. That page, when it gets to the 
    browser, it gets rendered by the browser and then the script runs down at the 
    bottom of the page and affects the page after that paragraph has already been 
    rendered. It happens so fast, you don't even really see it. But this is a 
    really great example of a document method, getElementById, which is allowing 
    us to go into our document, find that ID, and then effect it on the page. -->
